PROC TABULATE TABLES 

Introduction
This section provides an overview of the PROC TABULATE tables generated in the SAS project. The tables aim to explore relationships between various demographic and socioeconomic attributes in the "Adult" dataset, utilizing the PROC TABULATE procedure.

Table 1.1 - Average Hours Worked by Education and Income
Objective: Explore the correlation between education, income, and average hours worked.

Key Findings:
Higher education levels correlate with increased average hours worked.
Individuals with advanced degrees tend to work longer hours, especially in the '>50K' income category.
The 'Preschool' category has a missing value for '>50K' income, indicating potential data gaps.

Table 1.2 - Complex Table of Hours Worked by Education and Income
Objective: Confirm patterns in average hours worked across different education levels and income categories.

Key Findings:
Higher education levels show a positive correlation with longer working hours.
Different patterns in average hours worked are observed across various education levels.

Table 1.3 - Summary Statistics by Education and Gender
Objective: Analyze summary statistics of hours worked per week by education level and gender.

Key Findings:
Individuals with an income >50K exhibit higher mean and sum of hours worked.
Mean and sum of hours worked generally increase with education level, particularly for individuals with a Doctorate and income >50K.

Table 2.1 - Scatter Plot of Age and Hours per Week by Income
Objective: Visualize the relationship between age and hours worked by income.

Interpretation:
No clear pattern is identified between age and hours worked.
Age alone does not explain the variation in working hours.

Table 2.2 - Vertical Bar Chart of Average Hours Worked by Education and Income
Objective: Visualize the average hours worked per week by education level and income.

Interpretation:
Higher education levels, especially 'Doctorate' and 'Profschool,' are associated with longer average hours worked.
Professional schooling shows a positive correlation with increased working hours, particularly in the '>50K' income category.

Table 2.3 - Box Plot of Hours Worked per Week by Education Level and Gender
Objective: Examine the distribution of hours worked per week by education level and gender.

Interpretation:
Males generally have higher median hours worked compared to females, except at the bachelor level.
Outliers are observed, particularly for females at doctorate and prof school levels.

Conclusion
This section summarizes the key findings and insights gained from the PROC TABULATE tables, emphasizing the importance of education, income, and gender in understanding variations in working hours.
